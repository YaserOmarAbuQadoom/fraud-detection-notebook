# Fraud Detection Using Clustering and Anomaly Detection

This project explores **unsupervised machine learning** techniques to detect unusual or potentially fraudulent behavior.  
Since fraud rarely comes with labeled data, clustering and anomaly detection methods are effective for discovering hidden patterns.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This notebook performs:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Domain-driven feature engineering
- Clustering with **KMeans**
- Density-based detection with **HDBSCAN**
- Dimensionality reduction with **PCA**
- Advanced visualization with **t-SNE**
- Cluster interpretation and anomaly identification

The goal is to identify suspicious user or transaction behaviors using **unsupervised learning**.
